Reading text files is fine, but Shazam has an option of downloading a CSV from the account with a list of all the songs.
Besides the songs, it includes other data that can be included in our app's model, such as date, or id.
Make it possible to load the songs from a CSV instead of .txt, and add an option in the CLI that allows to choose
between one or the other. Use CSV as default if the option is not specified when using the command.
A sample of the data has been attached named 'ticket 3 attachment.csv', use it for development and testing.
Use the 'csv' module, and not the 'pandas' module for this
