Create a Python script that parses (reads) the file named 'Shazam.txt'.
The relevant content of the file is: index, song name, artist name.
The script should remove the garbage text (unnecessary text) from before and after the relevant content of the file.
Use Object Orient Programming (OOP).

Once the garbage text has been removed, and a list of all indexes, songs and artists is available,
separate each song from each other. Example:

list_of_everything = ['1', artist_1, song_1, '2', artist_2, song_2, '3', artist_3, song_3, ....] -->
list_of_songs = [('1', artist_1, song_1), ('2', artist_2, song_2), ('3', artist_3, song_3), ....]

Create a class named Song, with 3 attributes: index, artist, song.
Create a __repr__ method so everything is printed when the object is printed.
Create a list of Song objects
