The Shazam file 'shazam.txt' is constantly being updated with new songs,
and the purpose of the app is to eventually download the songs,
it would be pointless to download all the songs every time, since we would already have most of them.

If it is the first time the songs are being downloaded, then all the songs in 'shazam.txt' should be downloaded.
And after that first round of downloads,
the app should create a json file named 'old_songs.json' with a list of the songs that just have been downloaded.

When the shazam file 'shazam.txt' gets updated with a few extra songs,
the app should compare the songs of the file with the songs in 'old_songs.json', and only download the new songs.
